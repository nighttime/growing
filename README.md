# Growing
For this collaborative art project, I was inspired by vegetation, natural growth, and pixels.

I wanted to explore organic motion dictated entirely by computation. Every aspect of the scene is generated probabilistically, which means that each tree is unique.

The leaves were painted and scanned by my partner. I conceived the concept and programmed the scene in Processing, carefully tuning and easing by hand to achieve motion that truly feels alive.
